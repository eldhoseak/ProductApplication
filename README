This REST application is developed using Spring boot. We can run the application in two modes namely dev
mode and prod mode.
1. Dev mode is default, to run the application we need to run in command prompt. Runs the application using
   in memory DB called H2.
      mvn spring-boot:run
   This will start the server in port 8090.

2. In prod mode, we need to pass extra argument along with above command.
     -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
   This will start the server in port 8085. This requires MySQL Schema 'springbootdb' in local DB.
   Try to match the details as shown in properties file. We don't need to create table upfront.


The application can be tested using Postman tool or so.

POST --http://localhost:8090/product
           use sample JSON {"unitPrice": 700,"name" : "Washing Machine","quantity": "3"}

GET -- http://localhost:8090/product
GET -- http://localhost:8090/product/Washing Machine


There are Junits as well created for this application, which can be found in test folder.
